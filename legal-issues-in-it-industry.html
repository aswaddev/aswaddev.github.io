        <h1>Legal Issues in IT Industry</h1>
        <p>
          As the IT industry rises to newer heights, many companies from small
          companies to large companies often overlook the regulations or the
          structure placed by the government and the regulatory bodies. This
          oversight may sometimes cost companies a lot. Today’s privacy laws and
          regulation laws lack consistency and transparency.
        </p>
        <p>The following are some of the key areas are as follows:</p>
        <h2>Customer Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          With the rise of e-commerce, social networks and online streaming,
          large amount of publicly as well as privately available data, is
          gathered, transferred and consumed over the internet. In such a
          fast-evolving environment, where online service providers have to
          adopt a business model where they can facilitate data collection and
          along with it provide services for free or cheap. Such services may be
          funded by advertising income where personal information is gathered,
          analyzed and then used for monetization purposes. Regulatory bodies
          worldwide have recommended to such service providers to adopt more
          transparency and obtain a user’s consent before using their data.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Evolution of Copyright Laws
        </h2>
        <p>
          Copyright laws have been changing and evolving over time, the most
          recent expansion of the internet copyright regulation has raised many
          controversies. In the IT world where internet has enabled individuals
          to record their ideas in words, images, videos and sounds and then
          release it to the world, in this kind of environment copyright laws
          and regulations are very crucial. Right now, if you upload something
          you've made, and then someone else steals it and posts to their site
          then it's on you, the individual, to figure that out and to try to get
          it taken down. But with more regulation and the recent evolution of
          the copyright laws, the company who infringes will be held responsible
          as they did not take proper measures to avoid copyright infringement.
        </p>
        <h2>Consumer Rights</h2>
        <p>
          Consumer rights, established under the laws of many countries,
          include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fair value, good quality and safety</li>
          <li>Fair and honest dealing</li>
          <li>Fair and reasonable marketing</li>
          <li>Supplier accountability</li>
          <li>Just and reasonable terms</li>
          <li>
            Redress mechanisms that are easy to access and quick to resolve
            issues
          </li>
          <li>Disclosure of information</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The above laws were put in place to prevent the suppliers from
          exploiting consumers. These laws also prevent retailers to gain an
          unfair competitive advantage over other retailers in order to protect
          consumers. The above laws make are critically applied even-handedly to
          online service providers and their competitors for consumer
          protection.
        </p>
        <h2>
          Legal Issues surrounding AI
        </h2>
        <p>
          Automation and AI has been disrupting every single industry, from
          manufacturing to clerical work. With the automation and capabilities
          of AI increasing exponentially, more and more jobs are lost. According
          to a McKinsey report, some 375 million jobs worldwide will be lost by
          2030. Except jobs there are also many other issues surrounding AI that
          need to be considered and regulated. Take self-driving cars for
          example, if an AI-powered car is faced with the split-second dilemma
          of hitting either a woman and a stroller, a homeless man, or a
          business executive, who writes the algorithm that makes that choice?
          Who decides who gets to live or die? Should it be computer
          programmers? This is where we need regulation and government
          intervention and proper AI regulatory frameworks need to be in place
          to prevent any issues.
